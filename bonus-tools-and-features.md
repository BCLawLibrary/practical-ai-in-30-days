## Features

An overview of useful features, non-exhaustive, user-facing "affordances". These are things that are outside of the typical LLMs capabilities. Remember, at their core, they are predicting the next word in a sequence. And because of various training methods, they are also able to identify when tasks fall outside of their inherint capabilities and "world knowledge and understanding". So, AI labs building out user interfaces for LLMs have given them some extra useful capabilities. This is known as tool calling or function calling if you were developing one of these features. As far as you're concerned, this is just give our AI assistant friends a boost in the capability, functionality, usefulness, and reliability department.

#### Custom Instructions

Allows us to give additional instruction or personal context that is added to the start of each new conversation. Think of it like a personal system prompt just for you, how you like to be addressed, instructions you want it to follow for each conversation regardless of what you're working on. This can be quite useful.

#### Custom Assistants, GPTs, Projects

However you want to call them, this is a feature in many chat tools that allow you to create, save, and share custom assistants. Different platforms allow for different functionality and different kinds of knowledge to be added. Check out each of the main platforms documentation to learn more. 

#### Sharing Chats

Useful for sharing interesting conversations, citation and attributing content to AI if needed for research or academic work, and more.

#### Data Analysis

Runs code in the interface to more accurately perform complex mathematics, data analysis in csv's or spreadsheets, or even generate graphs

#### Image Creation

Some models can perform this natively i.e. multimodal, and others use tool calling to call other image specific models to create images.

#### Web Search

Allows models to search the web for up to date information, search urls that you provide to ground the conversation in that material, etc.

#### Canvas/Artifacts

>Note: Most AI labs are settling on the name Canvas, however, Anthropic calls this feature artifacts.

These are separate resources created by the AI tool. Some interfaces allow you to edit these directly, others rely on the chat to make updates and changes to the created resource. 

#### Agentic Behavior

- Research
- Computer Use
- Task completion/automation
