## Understanding Agentic AI (Early 2025 ‚Üí Now)

You can think of agentic AI as systems that can accept a goal, plan multi-step work, call tools to perform actions (search, browse, code, apps), and return deliverables with minimal supervision. Some of the key areas of progress in recent months that have enabled this behavior include things like **tool use capabilities**, **long-context reasoning**, and **planning** tracking and execution capabilities.

Agentic systems differ from chatbots by:

1. **Planning**: Agents creating and keep track of multi-step workflows
2. **Calling tools**: Agents can use custom functionality either provided by the model companies, third-parties, or even written by you to autonomously control computer environments, run custom code, make calls to third-party or internal [APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs), or interact with [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) servers for richer context or additional functionality
3. **Autonomously complete deliverables**: With minimal supervision, agents can research and generate documents, write and send emails, check your calendar, and more.

These are crucial elements required to function as an assistant that _works on your behalf_. Since early 2025, mainstream tools added:

- **Agentic research modes** embedded in consumer UIs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity).
- **Practical computer use** controlling a browser or computer in a sandboxed environment.
- **Coding agents** with the ability to plan, execute, write, and validate code in common developer tools and workflows.

**What's Actually Happening Behind the Scenes**

When you give an agent a task like "research sustainable agriculture and create a presentation," it kicks off a very familiar process to what you would expect a human would do. For example, the AI might break your request into smaller steps (search for recent studies, find expert opinions, identify key trends), then proceed to execute each step using available tools (web search, document creation, data analysis), and all the while, keeps track of progress sometimes even adapting the plan based on what it discovers.

Think of it like having a very methodical research assistant who can work with multiple browser tabs, take notes, and create documents simultaneously. Some services even orchestrate multiple agents at once, speeding up the process and bringing the necessary context back to the managing agent to review, synthesize and attempt to complete the task it was originally set out to do! Unlike the conversational AI we've been used to, these systems can actually _do things_ in the digital world, not just talk about doing them.

**The Cost of Vague Instructions**

Equally important is that these agentic workflows take considerably more time. Instead of instantly streaming the response back to you, it could take upwards of 20-30 minutes to perform the request. This is important to understand for a few reasons. First, because of the literal processing involved. Second, and more critically, it highlights the importance of giving clear instructions. If you give a vague or confusing task to a human assistant for a long-term project, you risk receiving subpar results, wasting both their time and yours.

With an AI agent, that risk is magnified. Because of their autonomous nature, mistakes made early on can compound, and there are fewer opportunities to intervene and course-correct. The result can be wasted processing time and, more importantly, wasted personal time reviewing a flawed deliverable. Clear, specific goals aren't just a good habit; they are essential for successful collaboration with agentic AI.

Don't be afraid to invest time upfront to craft specific, goal-oriented prompts. Think of it as the difference between telling someone "plan something fun for this weekend" versus "find 3 outdoor activities within 2 hours of Boston for this Saturday, consider a $200 budget and rainy weather backup options."

## üìù Challenge (doable with free or common accounts)

> Focus on _handing off a task_ and observing planning + tool use. It is highly encouraged to adapt any of these ideas to meet your needs. Pro Tip: use one of the site's chat assistants to help you brainstorm other ideas to pursue!

**A) Research (any one)**

- "Create a 2-week self-guided module on _[topic]_ with readings, an activity per day, and a 1-page rubric. Provide sources with links."  
  Try in **ChatGPT Deep Research**, **Gemini Deep Research**, and **Perplexity Deep Research**; compare depth, citations, and follow-ups.

- "Research the current job market for _[your field]_ including salary ranges, in-demand skills, and growth projections. Create a career development plan with actionable steps."

**B) Computer Use (any one)**

- "Find events related to _[your interests]_ happening in _[your city]_ over the next month, compare options, and create a Google Doc with the top 5 choices including dates, costs, and why I'd be interested."

- "Help me find and compare 3 professional development courses on _[topic]_, check reviews and pricing, then draft an email to my supervisor requesting funding."

- "Research and book a venue for a 30-person workshop on _[date]_, compare availability/price, and draft a booking email in my professional tone."

**C) Coding (for the curious/adventurous)**

**Practical Tools for Daily Life:**

- "Create a personalized student randomizer for cold calling. I want to upload a CSV with names and persist the data so I can equitably call on students throughout the semester."
- "Help me create a spaced repetition learning app for topics I'm currently studying, with progress tracking and customizable review intervals."
- "Build a Google App script that watches a directory for new documents and auto-summarizes them as they arrive, organizing summaries by date and topic."

**Fun & Games:**

- "Help me create a multiplayer trivia game focused on _[class topic]_ that my project team can play during breaks to learn while having fun."

Try these in **Replit Agent**, **Cursor Agent**, or one of the CLI tools depending on your comfort level.

## üí° Tips for Success

- **Start Small**: Give a clear goal (‚ÄúDeliver a slide outline + a 1-page handout‚Äù), not just a topic.
- **Iterate**: Ask the agent to _show its plan first_, then approve/refine before execution.
- **Compare**: Run the same task in two tools; discuss differences in planning, citations, and final artifacts.

---

## üîí Privacy & Security Considerations

**Environment Check**

- What's visible on camera/screen? Who can overhear? Are any sensitive documents visible?

**Know Your Data**

- These tools learn from interactions to improve their systems. Before sharing anything, think: "Would I be comfortable if this conversation helped train future AI models?"
- Never use 'Confidential' or 'Strictly Confidential' data (as defined by [BC's Data Security Policy](<https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/offices/policies/pdf/policies/2018/Data%20Security%20Policy%20rev%206%205%2018%20(00013718xC24C8).pdf>)) in any online AI tool without university review.

**Getting Started Safely**

- **Test with generic or low stakes examples first**: Try "Create a lesson plan for teaching [insert topic]" or "Plan a weekend vacation for 3 to go leaf peeping in New England starting from Upstate New York." before using your actual course materials.
- **Use privacy controls**: Most consumer AI tools now offer options to [control your data](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/offices/its/about/its-news/2025/privacy-controls-ai-tools.html) - turn off training, delete conversations, or use temporary sessions.
- **Start with observation**: For computer use agents, watch what they plan to do before giving permission. Most tools show you their intended actions and ask for approval.

**Setting Your Comfort Level**

- **Full autonomy**: Research tasks using publicly available information
- **Step-by-step approval**: Computer use tasks where you approve each action
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Coding projects where you review all changes before running

The goal is to explore these capabilities while being thoughtful about what you share and how much control you maintain.

## ü§î A Moment for Reflection

Integrating powerful AI agents into our work and learning requires more than just technical skill‚Äîit calls for thoughtful reflection. As we delegate tasks and partner with these tools, it's crucial to consider _how_ we use them, not just _what_ they can do for us.

Before you dive deeper, take a moment to consider these questions:

**On Delegation and Discernment:**

- **What is worthy of your attention?** Which tasks are tedious and suitable for offloading to an AI agent, freeing you up for more meaningful work? Conversely, which tasks are core to your learning, your intellectual formation, or your professional contribution that should remain human-led or human-only?
- **Are you augmenting or abdicating?** Is the agent acting as a partner that helps you think better, or is it a substitute for your own critical thinking and effort? How can you ensure you are using these tools to enhance your skills, not let them atrophy? Remember, no matter what, you are ultimately responsible for AI generated output you choose to use.

**On Diligence and Collaboration:**

- **What does it mean to be a "good collaborator" with an AI?** This requires diligence. It means understanding the tool's limitations, actively verifying its outputs, and taking responsibility for the final product. How will you hold yourself accountable for the work you produce with an AI assistant?
- **Where should you be most active?** In any process, there are moments for planning, execution, and review. Where is your human insight most valuable? Is it in setting the initial goal and constraints? In reviewing the agent's plan? In critically evaluating the final output?

**On Community and Impact:**

- **How does your use of AI affect others?** Consider the impact on your classmates, colleagues, and the broader community. Are you using these tools in a way that is fair, honest, and respects the intellectual contributions of others?

There are no easy answers, but engaging with these questions will help you develop a framework for using AI not just effectively, but also wisely and ethically.
