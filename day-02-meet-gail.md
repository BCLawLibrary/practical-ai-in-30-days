# Day 2: Meet Gail!
### 🎯 Objective: 
- Get to know AI through a guided conversation with GAIL, the GenAI Literacy Assistant.

### 🛠️ Tools: 
- GAIL [GenAI Literacy Assistant](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-W3CyCFiIa-gail-genai-literacy-assistant)

### 📝 Challenge:
- Ask GAIL about generative AI and how it might be useful to you. 

Sample prompts:
1. "What’s one practical way I could use generative AI in my daily life at BC Law?"
2. "Can you explain how AI generates text or images in simple terms?"
3. "What’s the best way to learn prompt engineering?"

💡 **Tip**: 

Don’t just stick to one question—use this as an opportunity to explore. For example, if GAIL mentions something new, follow up with, “Can you give me an example of that?”

✨ **Bonus**:
Gail can help you understand any of the topics throughout the rest of this guided journey. Each day will have a copy content dropdown menu. There will be an option to "copy for Gail" which includes the day's content in markdown format (don't worry, you'll learn what that means later!) along with a starter prompt to help kickstart the conversation. Go ahead and give it a try on this page to see how it works.
