### üéØ Objective: 
- Get to know AI through a guided conversation with GAIL, the GenAI Literacy Assistant.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools: 
- GAIL [GenAI Literacy Assistant](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-W3CyCFiIa-gail-genai-literacy-assistant)

### üìù Challenge:

**Option 1: Explore Generative AI**
- Ask GAIL about generative AI and how it might be useful to you. 
- Use GAIL to explore AI topics focused on AI first principles and practical applications for people just like you!

Sample prompts:
1. "What's one practical way I could use generative AI in my daily life at BC Law?"
2. "Can you explain how AI generates text or images in simple terms?"
3. "What's the best way to learn prompt engineering?"

**Option 2: Test Your Knowledge**
Use GAIL to assess your AI knowledge. You can ask to be quizzed on generative AI from the perspective of an end user of these tools. Copy and paste the prompt below as your first chat to GAIL to get started.

```
I want you to quiz me on my generative AI knowledge. Please ask 1 question at a time. It can be on a range of topics and difficulty levels focusing on AI first principles and applications from the perspective of the end user of these tools. After each question, you should ask me if I want to stay in the same category, increase the difficulty, ask a different question type, or some version of all three.
```

For fun, when you're done, ask the model to score your knowledge!

üí° **Tips for talking with GAIL**: 

Don't just stick to one question‚Äîuse this as an opportunity to explore. For example, if GAIL mentions something new, follow up with, "Can you give me an example of that?"

‚ú® **Bonus**:
Gail can help you understand any of the topics throughout the rest of this guided journey. Each day will have a copy content dropdown menu. There will be an option to copy for a "Comprehension Assistant" which includes the day's content in markdown format (don't worry, you'll learn what that means later!) along with a starter prompt to help kickstart the conversation. Go ahead and give it a try on this page to see how it works. Once the content is copied to your clipboard you can paste it as the first message to Gail or your AI assistant of choice.
