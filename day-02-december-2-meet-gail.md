# Day 2: December 2: Meet Gail!
### 🎯 Objective: 
- Get to know AI through a guided conversation with GAIL, the GenAI Literacy Assistant.

### 🛠️ Tools: 
- GAIL [GenAI Literacy Assistant](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-W3CyCFiIa-gail-genai-literacy-assistant)

### 📝 Challenge:
- Ask GAIL about generative AI and how it might be useful to you. 

Sample prompts:
1. "What’s one practical way I could use generative AI in my daily life at BC Law?"
2. "Can you explain how AI generates text or images in simple terms?"
3. "What’s the best way to learn prompt engineering?"

💡 **Tip**: 

Don’t just stick to one question—use this as an opportunity to explore. For example, if GAIL mentions something new, follow up with, “Can you give me an example of that?”

✨ **Bonus**: 

Share one cool insight you learned from GAIL on social media (tag @bclawlibrary on Instagram or TikTok) or with a colleague!
