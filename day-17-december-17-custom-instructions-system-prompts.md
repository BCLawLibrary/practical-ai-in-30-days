#### What is a System Prompt or Custom Instructions?

A **system prompt** (or [**custom instructions**](https://sites.bc.edu/bclawedtech/2023/10/10/system-prompt/)) is a detailed set of guidelines that you provide to an AI assistant at the start of a conversation. It defines the assistant‚Äôs persona, behavior, and the type of task it should perform. Think of it as a script that tells the AI how to act and respond consistently.

Example system prompt:

"You are a friendly and efficient email assistant who helps draft professional emails based on bullet points. Always use a clear and concise tone, and check for spelling or grammar errors before finalizing the email."

#### Steps to Create Your Custom Assistant:

1. **Define the Persona**: Who is your assistant? (e.g., a meticulous legal clerk, a cheerful email assistant, or a creative brainstorming partner).

2. **Set Rules & Guidelines**: Outline the behavior and tone. What should they always do or avoid?

3. **(Optional) Add Multi-Shot Examples**: Provide a few sample interactions to show how the assistant should respond.

4. **Include Error Handling**: If colleagues or students use this assistant, add instructions on what to do when errors occur or define interactions or topics to avoid.

5. **Save & Iterate**: Save your system prompt in your preferred tool or set up your assistant in one of the paid/free platforms.
