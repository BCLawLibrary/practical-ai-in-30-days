# Day 8: AI Impact Reflection Journal ü§î
## **Professional Development**

### üéØ Objective:

Explore and document your personal journey with AI tools over the past week of activities

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools:

- AI Writing/Conversation Partners:  
  - [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)  
  - [Claude](https://claude.ai)  
  - [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)
  - [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com)

### üìù Challenge:

Craft a reflection that captures your experiences with AI tools this past week. Structure your reflection around these key areas:

1. Your AI Journey  
   - Your most memorable AI experience from the past week
   - Was there a moment using AI that surprised you?  
   - Was there a moment that concerned you?
2. Professional Identity  
   - Did AI help you learn any new skills this week?  
   - Did you use AI to improve any of your existing skills or workflows?  
   - Were there any tasks you thought AI might be able to help? Did you chose to use AI? Why or why not?  
3. Short Term Goals  
   - How do you plan to use AI in your work or personal life next week?  
   - What would you like to try differently with AI?
   - Is there an AI tool or concept you want to explore further?

**Example prompt**: 
"Help me reflect on my AI journey by asking thoughtful follow-up questions about my initial reactions, evolving perspectives, and key moments that shaped my views. Ask one question at a time to help me dig deeper."

**Bonus**:
You can share the activities you completed as part of your prompt. Including any notes, reflections, or other resources or material you'd like to share.

**üí° Tip**: There are no "right" answers -- Focus on honest reflection. Your understanding and relationship with AI will evolve over time. Think of this reflection as a snapshot capturing your current thoughts, which you can revisit later. 

**Optional**: Share your reflection with a colleague and discuss areas of alignment and difference in your experiences.
