# BC AI Literacy Project 🎓

Welcome to the BC AI Literacy Project - a comprehensive repository of daily activities designed to build AI competency and literacy. This project provides a structured, 30-day learning experience that can be customized for different departments and needs across Boston College.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains markdown-based activities that guide learners through various aspects of AI literacy. Each day presents a new topic, challenge, or learning opportunity, making AI education accessible and manageable.

### Key Features
- Roughly a month's worth of curated AI learning content
- Flexible, branch-based customization for different departments
- Hands-on activities and practical exercises
- Focus on both theoretical understanding and practical application

## 📚 Content Structure

Each day's content is organized in markdown files following one of two formats:

1. **General Exploration**: An activity/concept designed to quickly explore tools and concepts without any specific prior knowledge necessary.
2. **Mini-Lesson**: An in depth exploration of a specific tool or concept with an accompanying challenge.
