### üìù Knowledge Cutoffs:

Because of the nature of the training process, AI language models have a "knowledge cutoff." This means they are not aware of events or data that have occurred after their last training date. While these dates are constantly being updated with new model releases, the concept of a knowledge cutoff is an important limitation to be aware of.

This is why AI-powered search tools (and chat assistants with live web access) are so powerful‚Äîthey can combine the reasoning and summarization abilities of a large language model with up-to-the-minute information from the internet.

#### Getting Past Knowledge Cutoffs

However, a knowledge cutoff doesn't prevent a model from discussing current topics. You just have to be aware that for bleeding-edge content, it's best if you supply the specific information, articles, or data related to your query as part of your chat to give the AI context.

Alternatively, if you know a model has internet search capabilities provided by the features offered in the platform, it may intelligently use the internet to answer your question. You can also directly ask an AI chat assistant with these capabilities to use it's search tool if it's available. This is often achieved by enabling the search feature in the UI of the application or by simply asking it to use web search as part of your prompt.

Here are some of the platforms that offer internet search:

- **ChatGPT:** Great for conversational AI and browsing capabilities.
- **Google Search with AI Overview:** Integrates AI summaries into traditional Google search.
- **Perplexity:** Searches the internet to give you an accessible, conversational, and verifiable answer.
  - Note: Perplexity uses one of the common foundational models to summarize and synthesize material. You can choose from different foundational models in your settings (a paid plan is required to choose).
- **Google's chat assistant Gemini:** Evaluate and cite responses with the "Double Check Responses" feature.
- **Mistral:** A French model that has internet search capabilities.
- **DeepSeek:** A Chinese model that has internet search capabilities.
- **Grok:** Has internet access and can intelligently search the web to fill missing context.
- **Claude:** Recently announced internet search capabilities for improved responses for up to date information.

## üí° Tips for Success:

- **Source Quality:** Pay attention to the sources cited. Are they reputable?
- **Verification:** Always double-check critical information, especially for professional or academic purposes.
- **Synthesis:** Notice how AI synthesizes data compared to traditional search engines.
- **Citations:** Most platforms cite sources now. If not, use the "ask for sources" , "verify sources" or other similar features when available.

## üìö Reflection Questions

- After exploring with AI search tools, reflect on your experience.
- Did a particular feature stand out to you?
- How did using a tool with search capabilities compare to just chatting with an LLM?
