# Day 11: December 11: AI Search Explorer 🔍
## **AI-Powered Search in Action!**

### 🎯 **Objective:**

Learn how AI-powered search tools differ from traditional search engines and understand their strengths and limitations.

### 🛠️ **Tools:**

- **AI Search Engines:**
  - [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai) (3 Pro searches free daily)
  - [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) (with Browse capability)

### 📝 **Knowledge Cutoffs:**

AI language models are trained up to certain dates, meaning they may not know about events or data beyond these points. Here are some current knowledge cutoffs:

- **GPT-4o:** [October 2023](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** [April 2024](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models)
- **Gemini:** [August 2024](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat)

These cutoffs highlight why AI-powered search tools like Perplexity and ChatGPT with Browse capabilities are powerful — they combine AI’s reasoning skills with access to up-to-date information.

**Getting Around Knowledge Cutoffs**

A knowledge cutoff doesn't prevent a model from discussing current topics intelligently. You just have to be aware that for bleeding-edge content, it's best if you supply the specific information, articles, or data related to your query as part of your chat to give the AI context. Or if you know a model has internet search capabilities provided by the features offered in the platform:

- **ChatGPT:** Great for conversational AI and browsing capabilities.
- **Google Search with AI Overview:** Integrates AI summaries into traditional search.
- **Perplexity:** Searches the internet to give you an accessible, conversational, and verifiable answer.
  - Note: Perplexity uses one of the common foundational models to summarize and synthesize material. You can choose GPT-4o, Claude, etc. in your settings (a paid plan is required to choose).
- **Gemini:** Evaluate and cite responses with the "Double Check Responses" feature.
- **Claude:** Notably, at this time, Claude does not have access to the internet in the chat interface.

Then you can ask the model to use its search capabilities or provide a link for it to crawl.
