### üìù **Knowledge Cutoffs:**

Because of the nature of the training process AI language models have a natural knowledge cutoff. This means they do not know about events or data beyond these points. Here are some current knowledge cutoffs:

- **GPT-4.5:** [Sep 30, 2023](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4.5-preview)
- **GPT-4o:** [June 2024](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9624314-model-release-notes)
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet:** [October 2024](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/all-models#model-comparison-table)
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** [April 2024](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models)
- **Gemini:** [August 2024](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat)

These cutoffs highlight why AI-powered search tools like Perplexity, ChatGPT and other tools with browse capabilities are powerful ‚Äî they combine AI‚Äôs reasoning skills with access to up-to-date information.

**Getting Past Knowledge Cutoffs**

A knowledge cutoff doesn't prevent a model from discussing current topics intelligently. You just have to be aware that for bleeding-edge content, it's best if you supply the specific information, articles, or data related to your query as part of your chat to give the AI context. 

Alternatively, if you know a model has internet search capabilities provided by the features offered in the platform, it may intelligently use the internet to answer your question. You can also directly ask an AI chat assistant with these capabilities to use it's search tool if it's available. This is often achieved by enabling the search feature in the UI of the application or by simply asking it to use search as part of your prompt. Here are some of the platforms that offer internet search:

- **ChatGPT:** Great for conversational AI and browsing capabilities.
- **Google Search with AI Overview:** Integrates AI summaries into traditional Google search.
- **Perplexity:** Searches the internet to give you an accessible, conversational, and verifiable answer.
  - Note: Perplexity uses one of the common foundational models to summarize and synthesize material. You can choose GPT-4o, Claude, etc. in your settings (a paid plan is required to choose).
- **Gemini:** Evaluate and cite responses with the "Double Check Responses" feature.
- **Mistral:** A French model that has internet search capabilities.
- **DeepSeek:** A Chinese model that has internet search capabilities.
- **Grok:** Has internet access and can intelligently search the web to fill missing context.
- **Claude:** Notably, at this time, Claude **does not** have access to the internet in the chat interface.

## üåå Exploration Paths:

Choose one of these exploration paths to dive into AI-powered search!

### Path 1: Expert Verification

- **Step 1:** Pick a topic you know well professionally or academically.
- **Step 2:** Run searches about this topic using Perplexity or ChatGPT.
- **Step 3:** Compare the sources cited with ones you trust.
- **Step 4:** Analyze how the tool synthesizes information and check for any inaccuracies or oversimplifications.

---

### Path 2: Learning Journey

- **Step 1:** Select a current topic or trend you want to explore.
- **Step 2:** Run an initial broad search on Perplexity or ChatGPT.
- **Step 3:** Use the results to ask more specific follow-up questions.
- **Step 4:** Notice how the tool connects different sources and handles synthesizing information.

---

## üí° Tips for Success:

- **Source Quality:** Pay attention to the sources cited. Are they reputable?
- **Verification:** Always double-check critical information, especially for professional or academic purposes.
- **Synthesis:** Notice how AI synthesizes data compared to traditional search engines.
- **Citations:** Most platforms cite sources now. If not, use the "ask for sources" , "verify sources" or other similar features when available.

## üìö Reflection Questions

- After exploring with AI search tools, reflect on your experience.
- Did a particular feature stand out to you?
- How did using a tool with search capabilities compare to just chatting with an LLM?
