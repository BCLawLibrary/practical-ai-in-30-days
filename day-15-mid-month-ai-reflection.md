# Day 15: December 15: Mid-Month AI Reflection üìñ
### **üéØ Objective:**

Pause and reflect on your AI journey so far, identifying key insights, challenges, and areas for growth as you head into the second half of the advent calendar.

### **üõ†Ô∏è Tools:**

**AI Writing/Conversation Partners**:

* [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)  
* [Claude](https://claude.ai/)  
* [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)  
* [Copilot](http://copilot.microsoft.com)

**Example prompt**: "Help me reflect on my AI journey by asking thoughtful follow-up questions about my initial reactions, evolving perspectives, and key moments that shaped my views. Ask one question at a time to help me dig deeper."

### **üìù Challenge:**

Write a thoughtful reflection on your experiences with AI tools over the past two weeks. Use the following prompts to guide your writing:

1. **Insights Gained**:  
   * What‚Äôs the most surprising thing you've learned about using AI?  
   * Did any specific tool or activity stand out to you? Why?  
2. **Challenges and Curiosities**:  
   * Have you encountered any challenges or limitations with AI tools?  
   * Are there any AI concepts or tools you want to explore more deeply?  
3. **Applications and Goals**:  
   * How have these activities influenced your professional or personal workflows?  
   * What are your goals for using AI in the coming weeks?

### **üå± Reflecting on the Week:**

This past week focused on AI literacy, exploring new search tools, and refining your prompting techniques. As you think about your experiences, consider these broader questions:

* How can you use AI more intentionally in your work or studies?  
* What is your **‚Äúspecial sauce‚Äù** as a human ‚Äî the unique skills, creativity, or perspectives that AI can't replicate?  
* As educators (or in your own profession), how should we be rethinking our roles in a world where AI is increasingly capable?  
* What might the future of work look like, and how can you prepare for it?

**Alternative Prompt**:  
*"Reflect on how AI tools complement your unique strengths and skills. Where do you see AI enhancing your work, and where do you think human judgment, creativity, or empathy still reign supreme?"*

### **üí° Tips for Reflection:**

* **Be Honest**: This is a chance to acknowledge what worked and what didn‚Äôt.  
* **Consider Growth**: How has your confidence or understanding of AI tools changed?  
* **Set Intentions**: Identify one practical way you plan to use AI more effectively in the next week.

### **‚ú® Bonus Challenge:**

Share one key insight from your reflection with a colleague, classmate, or on social media (tag @bclawlibrary). Discuss how your experiences align or differ.
