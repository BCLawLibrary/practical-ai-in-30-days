Write a thoughtful reflection on your experiences with AI tools over the past two weeks. Use the following prompts to guide your writing:

1. **Insights Gained**:

   * What are your goals for using AI in the coming weeks?

### üå± Reflecting on the Week:

This past week focused on AI literacy, exploring new search tools, and refining your prompting techniques. As you think about your experiences, consider these broader questions:

* How can you use AI more intentionally in your work or studies?  
* What is your **‚Äúspecial sauce‚Äù** as a human ‚Äî the unique skills, creativity, or perspectives that AI can't replicate?  
* As educators (or in your own profession), how should we be rethinking our roles in a world where AI is increasingly capable?  
* What might the future of work look like, and how can you prepare for it?

**Alternative Prompt**:  

"Help me reflect on how AI tools complement my unique strengths and skills. Could you guide me through topics like where I see AI enhancing my work, and where do I think human judgment, creativity, or empathy still require the human touch?"
