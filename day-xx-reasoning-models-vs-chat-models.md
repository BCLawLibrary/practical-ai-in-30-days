## üìö The Two Faces of Modern AI: Chat vs. Reasoning Models

### Why This Matters to You

In today's AI landscape, there's a growing division between two types of AI models: traditional **chat models** and newer **reasoning models**. Understanding this distinction is crucial because:

1. **It affects how you should communicate with the AI** - each type requires different prompting techniques
2. **It determines which AI to choose for different tasks** - some jobs are better suited for one type over the other
3. **It impacts your results and productivity** - using the wrong approach can lead to poor outputs or wasted time

Think of it like knowing whether you're talking to a quick-responding colleague (chat model) or a thoughtful researcher who needs time to consider problems deeply (reasoning model) - your communication style would naturally differ between these two people.

It's helpful to think of these types as existing on a spectrum. While we categorize them for clarity, some models possess strong capabilities in both areas. The key difference lies in their primary optimization ‚Äì what they are fundamentally designed to excel at: rapid interaction versus deep deliberation.

### A Simple Comparison

**Chat Models** (like standard ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini):

- Optimized for interactive, conversational experiences
- Quick responses (seconds)
- Excel at creative tasks, basic information retrieval, and iterative refinement
- Often benefit from explicit, detailed instructions

**Reasoning Models** (like OpenAI's o-series, Claude with Extended Thinking):

- Optimized for deep analysis and complex problem-solving
- Longer response times (often minutes) due to internal deliberation
- Excel at multi-step reasoning, handling ambiguity, and analyzing complex information
- Often perform best with clear goals but fewer constraints on their reasoning process

## üîç How Reasoning Models Work

Reasoning models aren't just chat models that take longer to respond - they're architecturally optimized for thorough analysis. Here's what makes them different:

- **Internal Deliberation**: These models use reinforcement learning techniques that encourage exploring multiple approaches and self-correcting errors before providing a final answer

- **Emergent Problem-Solving**: Rather than following prescribed reasoning patterns, they develop their own effective strategies through extensive training

- **Integrated Chain-of-Thought**: While you might prompt chat models to "think step by step," reasoning models have this behavior built into their design

- **Extended Computation**: They allocate significantly more computational resources to each response, allowing deeper analysis

When you interact with a reasoning model, you'll notice:

- The visible "thinking" process might reveal how the model explores multiple paths before settling on an answer
- Responses naturally break complex problems into manageable components
- The model self-corrects when it encounters logical contradictions

## Prompting Tips and Strategies

### The Collaborative AI Mindset

When working with AI models, especially reasoning models:

1. **Provide rich context**: The quality of output often correlates directly with the quality and relevance of the context you provide
2. **Iterate and refine**: Treat the initial response as a starting point for a deeper collaboration
3. **Augment rather than replace**: Use AI to enhance your thinking process, not to outsource it entirely
4. **Guide with expertise**: Your domain knowledge is invaluable in steering the model toward useful outputs

For each of the tasks in the challenges section, consider what relevant context you might add from your own knowledge or preliminary research to improve the quality of the AI's response. Some tasks will benefit from this additional context more than others.

### Collaborative Workflow Considerations

When working with these tasks, consider experimenting with different collaborative workflows:

1. **Initial Research ‚Üí AI Exploration**

   - For some tasks, doing preliminary research before engaging with AI can dramatically improve results
   - Try gathering key facts, figures, or scholarly perspectives first, then incorporating this information in your prompt

2. **AI Draft ‚Üí Human Refinement ‚Üí AI Polish**

   - Use AI to generate initial ideas or structure
   - Apply your expertise to refine, correct, or redirect
   - Return to AI with specific guidance for final polish

3. **Multi-Model Approach**
   - Try using a chat model for initial brainstorming
   - Then use a reasoning model for deeper analysis of the most promising ideas
   - Compare how different models complement each other

### Effective Prompting

The key to success with advanced AI models is understanding their different interaction patterns and optimizing your prompts accordingly.

**For Reasoning Models:**

1. **Write comprehensive "briefs" not short prompts**

   - Think of it as preparing a detailed memo outlining the project goal and context
   - Include all relevant background, data, and constraints in one submission

2. **Front-load with extensive context (be generous with relevant background)**

   - Provide the necessary background for the model to understand the full picture
   - Specify any relevant terminology, methodologies, or frameworks
   - Provide historical context and previous work in the area

3. **Clearly state your desired output format and high-level goals upfront**

   - Explicitly define what success looks like (the final deliverable)
   - Specify document format, section headings, or structure if critical
   - State whether you need analysis, recommendations, or implementation plans

4. **Focus on WHAT you want, trusting the model with the HOW**

   - Delegate the task by defining the objective and letting the model determine the best reasoning path
   - Define clear deliverables rather than prescribing a step-by-step process

5. **Provide clear criteria for evaluation**
   - List specific requirements the output must satisfy
   - Include any constraints or considerations that must be respected

**For Chat Models:**

1. **Start with clear, focused requests**

   - Begin with a specific task or question to establish context
   - Provide enough initial detail for the model to get started

2. **Use follow-up questions to refine and direct the conversation**

   - Provide feedback on initial responses to guide the model
   - Ask for clarification or expansion on specific points
   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps through conversation

3. **Provide feedback and correction in an iterative process**

   - Treat the interaction as a collaborative dialogue
   - Redirect the model when it misunderstands or goes off-track

4. **Be more specific about HOW you want the model to approach the question**
   - Request specific methods, steps, or frameworks if needed
   - Specify tone, style, and level of detail in your requests

## üìù Challenge: Compare Model Types

This hands-on challenge will help you directly experience the differences between chat and reasoning models through experimentation. Rather than prescribing rigid approaches, we encourage you to observe how different model types handle the same tasks and discover which works best for your specific needs.

### Part 1: Hands-On Comparison (20-25 minutes)

Choose one of the tasks below or come up with your own idea and try it with both a reasoning model and a chat model. Pay attention to differences in:

- Depth and thoroughness of analysis
- Approach to breaking down the problem
- Time to generate responses
- Overall quality and usefulness of output

These prompts are designed to help you experience the differences between chat models and reasoning models across various domains and use cases. Rather than viewing AI as a tool that simply delivers answers, consider these exercises as opportunities for collaborative thinking and augmentation of your own expertise.

**Sample Tasks:**

**Option A: Legal Ethics Framework for AI Use in Practice**

```
I'm developing an ethics training program for attorneys working with AI tools in their practice. Help me create a decision-making framework based on ABA Formal Opinion 512 that addresses:

1. Competence requirements when using AI tools for legal work
2. Protecting client confidentiality when utilizing AI systems
3. Communication obligations regarding AI use with clients
4. Maintaining candor toward tribunals when using AI-generated content
5. Supervisory responsibilities for AI use by subordinate attorneys and staff
6. Ethical billing practices for AI-assisted work

The framework should include practical scenarios and guiding questions that attorneys can apply in their daily practice.

Additional Context:
- This training is for a mid-sized law firm (50+ attorneys) that practices in litigation, corporate, and intellectual property law
- The firm is considering implementing several AI tools for document review, legal research, and drafting
- Several senior partners are concerned about maintaining ethical compliance while adopting these technologies
- We want to create clear guidelines that align with ABA Formal Opinion 512 while enabling innovation
- Some attorneys are tech-savvy while others have limited experience with advanced technology
```

**Option B: Comprehensive Vacation Planning**

```
I'm planning a 10-day trip to Japan in October with my family (two adults, one teenager). We're interested in experiencing both traditional and modern aspects of Japanese culture, enjoy outdoor activities, and enjoy traditional culinary experiences. We have a budget of $2800 not including round-trip airfare.

Please create a detailed itinerary that:
- Prefer cultural experiences and less touristy attractions
- limit travel to less than 2 hours per day
- Must include Kyoto and budget and time permitting exploring the island of Hokkaido
- Includes accommodation recommendations for each location
- Addresses transportation between cities
- Suggests restaurants that can accommodate our dietary needs
- Includes estimated costs for the major components
- Identifies potential challenges and how to prepare for them
```

**Option C: Standardizing Processes**

```
I need to create standardized procedures for important processes in my area of responsibility. Help me design an approach for developing effective SOPs.

My context:
- I manage a team of 15 people in healthcare billing operations
- We've had significant compliance issues due to inconsistent processes
- Many team members have been with the organization for 10+ years and resist documentation
- We need to balance regulatory requirements with practical usability

Please provide:
- A flexible template or framework for documenting our billing procedures
- Principles for creating SOPs that balance compliance with usability
- Methods for ensuring adoption among experienced staff who "already know what to do"
- Approaches for maintaining and updating SOPs as regulations change

I want to avoid overly rigid documentation while still ensuring consistency in our operations.
```

**Bonus Challenge: Creative Comparison (Optional)**
For a fun comparison focused on creativity, try the following prompt with both a chat model and a reasoning model:

```
Write the opening paragraph (around 100 words) of a whimsical fantasy story about a meticulous librarian who discovers a dusty, forgotten book that begins talking to them, complaining about being ignored for centuries.
```

Compare the results:

- Which model produced a more imaginative or original opening?

- How did the writing style and tone differ?

- Did one model capture the 'whimsical' nature better than the other?

- Was one more coherent or engaging?

This exercise can highlight how different models approach less analytical, more open-ended creative tasks.

### Part 2: Experiment with Different Prompting Styles

Now, try variations of your chosen prompt with each model type to see how prompting style affects results.

**For Chat Models:**
Add more specific instructions like:

```
Think step by step. First, identify the key issues. Then analyze each issue individually. Finally, provide a comprehensive conclusion synthesizing your findings.
```

**For Reasoning Models:**
Try a more open-ended approach:

```
Please think about this thoroughly and provide your most comprehensive analysis.
```

**Reverse the approach:**
See what happens when you give chat models more open-ended prompts and reasoning models more structured prompts.

## üí° Real-World Applications

Understanding which model to use and how to prompt it effectively can dramatically improve your results in various academic and professional contexts:

| **Task Type**          | **Preferred Model** | **Examples**                                         |

| Iterative development  | Chat                | Collaborative document creation, feedback cycles     |

## How to Compare Model Responses

When comparing responses between chat models and reasoning models, consider:

1. **Depth of analysis**: Which model provided more thorough consideration of complex factors?

2. **Context utilization**: How effectively did each model incorporate the context you provided?

3. **Structure and organization**: How did each model organize its response? Which was more logical and easier to follow?

4. **Creativity and insight**: Did one model offer more novel or unexpected perspectives?

5. **Collaborative potential**: Which response provided better scaffolding for your continued thinking and input?

6. **Practical usefulness**: Which response would be more actionable or helpful for your actual needs?

7. **Limitations acknowledgment**: Did the model recognize the boundaries of its knowledge or the complexity of the task?

8. **Response time**: How long did each model take to generate its response, and was the quality worth the wait?

Remember that different tasks may favor different model types, and your specific needs should guide which approach works best for you. The ideal workflow often involves leveraging multiple AI capabilities while maintaining your role as the director of the collaborative process.
