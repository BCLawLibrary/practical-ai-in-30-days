## üìö The Two Faces of Modern AI: Chat vs. Reasoning Models

### Why This Matters to You

In today's AI landscape, there's a growing division between two types of AI models: traditional **chat models** and newer **reasoning models**. Understanding this distinction is crucial because:

1. **It affects how you should communicate with the AI** - each type requires different prompting techniques
2. **It determines which AI to choose for different tasks** - some jobs are better suited for one type over the other
3. **It impacts your results and productivity** - using the wrong approach can lead to poor outputs or wasted time

Think of it like knowing whether you're talking to a quick-responding colleague (chat model) or a thoughtful researcher who needs time to consider problems deeply (reasoning model) - your communication style would naturally differ between these two people.

### A Simple Comparison

**Chat Models** (like standard ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini):
- Quick, conversational responses (seconds)
- Back-and-forth dialogue style
- Good for creative tasks, simple questions, brainstorming
- Prefer step-by-step guidance in your prompts

**Reasoning Models** (like OpenAI's o1 series, DeepSeek R1, Claude with Extended Thinking):
- Slower, more thorough responses (minutes)
- "Submit once, get comprehensive answer" style
- Excel at complex problems, analysis, and planning
- Prefer receiving all context upfront with clear goals

## üîç How Reasoning Models Work

Unlike chat models which are optimized for dialogue, reasoning models have been specially trained to spend more time "thinking" before responding. Here's what makes them different:

- **Internal Deliberation**: They run through multiple rounds of analysis before providing an answer
- **Self-Correction**: They can identify and fix their own reasoning errors
- **Depth Over Speed**: They prioritize thoroughness over quick responses
- **Built-in Chain of Thought**: They naturally work through problems step-by-step without needing to be prompted

This makes reasoning models particularly valuable for tasks requiring deep analysis, complex problem-solving, and situations where accuracy is more important than quick responses.

When you interact with a reasoning model, you might notice:
- Responses take 2-5 minutes rather than seconds
- The model might show its "thinking" process in an expandable section
- Answers tend to be more structured and comprehensive
- The model naturally breaks down complex problems into manageable parts

## üìù Challenge: Compare Model Types

### **Part 1: Understanding the Difference (10 minutes)**

Try interacting with both a chat model and a reasoning model to feel the difference firsthand. Pick a complex topic from your field and notice how:

- **Chat models** respond quickly but might oversimplify
- **Reasoning models** take longer but provide more thorough analysis
- The interaction pattern feels fundamentally different

### **Part 2: Hands-on Comparison (15 minutes)**

Choose one of these academic or professional tasks and try it with both a reasoning model and a chat model. Notice the difference in depth, coherence, and thoroughness of the responses:

**Option A: Legal Case Analysis**
- Find a short legal case summary (or use one from your coursework)
- Ask both models to analyze the legal principles, potential arguments, and broader implications
- Compare how each model identifies nuances and connects to relevant precedents

**Option B: Research Project Planning**
- Select a complex research question from your field
- Ask both models to create a comprehensive research plan including:
  - Methodology selection with justification
  - Resource requirements and timeline
  - Potential challenges and mitigation strategies
  - Analysis approach for gathered data

**Option C: Implementation Planning**
- Describe a complex project (like creating a new clinical program, tech implementation, or academic initiative)
- Ask both models to develop a phased implementation plan with:
  - Stakeholder analysis
  - Resource allocation
  - Risk assessment
  - Success metrics

**Option D: Document Creation**
- Request a complex document creation (grant proposal, policy document, technical specification)
- Compare how each model structures the document and anticipates requirements

### **Part 3: Optimizing Your Prompts (20 minutes)**

The key to success with advanced AI models is understanding their different interaction patterns and optimizing your prompts accordingly.

**For Reasoning Models:**

1. **Write comprehensive "briefs" not short prompts**
   * Think of it as preparing a detailed memo for a senior partner or researcher
   * Include all relevant background, context, and constraints in one submission

2. **Front-load with extensive context (10x what you think is needed)**
   * Include detailed background information about your project, organization, or research
   * Specify any relevant terminology, methodologies, or frameworks
   * Provide historical context and previous work in the area

3. **Clearly state your desired output format and goals upfront**
   * Explicitly define what success looks like
   * Specify document format, section headings, or structure requirements
   * State whether you need analysis, recommendations, or implementation plans

4. **Focus on WHAT you want, not HOW the model should think**
   * Let the model determine its own reasoning approach
   * Specify desired outcomes rather than reasoning methods
   * Define clear deliverables rather than prescribing a thinking process

5. **Provide clear criteria for evaluation**
   * List specific requirements the output must satisfy
   * Include any constraints or considerations that must be respected
   * Specify the level of detail and comprehensiveness required

**For Chat Models:**

1. **Start with concise, clear questions**
   * Begin with a focused question to establish the conversation
   * Provide just enough context for the model to understand the basic task
   * Save detailed explanation for follow-up messages

2. **Use follow-up questions to refine and direct the conversation**
   * Provide feedback on initial responses to guide the model
   * Ask for clarification or expansion on specific points
   * Break complex tasks into smaller, sequential requests

3. **Provide feedback and correction in an iterative process**
   * Treat the interaction as a collaborative dialogue
   * Redirect the model when it misunderstands or goes off-track
   * Build on partial responses to reach your desired outcome

4. **Be more specific about HOW you want the model to approach the question**
   * Request specific methods or frameworks
   * Ask for step-by-step thinking or particular formats
   * Specify tone, style, and level of detail in your requests

## üí° Real-World Applications

Understanding which model to use and how to prompt it effectively can dramatically improve your results in various academic and professional contexts:

| **Task Type** | **Preferred Model** | **Examples** |
|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Complex analysis | Reasoning | Case analysis, research planning, policy development |
| Mathematical reasoning | Reasoning | Statistical approaches, quantitative methods |
| Multi-step planning | Reasoning | Project implementation, curriculum development |
| Creative work | Chat | Writing assistance, brainstorming ideas |
| Quick reference | Chat | Factual questions, brief explanations |
| Interactive learning | Chat | Tutorial-style assistance, concept explanations |
| Style-specific writing | Chat | Different writing styles, tone adaptation |
| Iterative development | Chat | Collaborative document creation, feedback cycles |

### Tips for Success:

**Working with Reasoning Models:**
- **Patience is key** - responses can take minutes, not seconds
- **Treat them like report generators**, not conversationalists
- **Provide all context upfront** rather than through back-and-forth
- **Use voice memos** to quickly capture and paste comprehensive context
- **Focus on a single, specific output request** per prompt
- **View the thinking process** when available to understand the model's approach
- **Save and reuse effective prompts** as templates for similar future tasks

**When to Use Each Type:**
- Use reasoning models when accuracy, thorough analysis, and comprehensive output matter most
- Use chat models when quick responses, creative brainstorming, or interactive collaboration is needed
- Consider your own workflow - do you prefer to craft one detailed prompt or engage in back-and-forth?

## üéØ Bonus Challenge: Crafting Optimal Prompts

### **Example Task: Creating a Course Curriculum Analysis**

Here's how you might approach the same task with different model types:

**For a Chat Model:**
```
I need help analyzing the curriculum for our law school's Environmental Law program. 
Could you help me identify any gaps compared to current environmental legal trends?
```
*Note: With a chat model, you would then engage in back-and-forth discussion, providing additional details about the curriculum as requested.*

**For a Reasoning Model:**
```
[CONTEXT]
I'm the curriculum coordinator for Boston College Law School's Environmental Law program. I need a comprehensive analysis of our current curriculum to identify gaps and opportunities for improvement.

Our current curriculum includes:
- Environmental Law Fundamentals (1L elective)
- Environmental Regulation (2L required)
- Climate Change Law & Policy (3L elective)
- Environmental Litigation Workshop (3L elective)
- Natural Resources Law (2L/3L elective)
- Environmental Justice Clinic (3L elective)

Key environmental law trends I'm aware of include growing focus on climate litigation, ESG regulations, environmental justice concerns, and international environmental agreements. The legal landscape is rapidly evolving with new EPA regulations and state-level initiatives.

Our program goals include:
1. Preparing students for practice in environmental law settings including government, nonprofit, and private sector
2. Building both theoretical knowledge and practical skills
3. Addressing contemporary environmental challenges
4. Incorporating interdisciplinary perspectives

Our constraints include:
- Limited faculty (4 full-time, 3 adjunct)
- Budget for only one new course per academic year
- Need to maintain bar passage rates
- Desire to increase law firm placement rates

[OUTPUT REQUEST]
Please provide:
1. A comprehensive gap analysis comparing our curriculum to current trends in environmental law
2. Three specific curriculum improvement recommendations with implementation strategies
3. A suggested priority order for these improvements with rationale

[EVALUATION CRITERIA]
A good analysis should:
- Consider both theoretical and practical skills development
- Address emerging areas of environmental law practice not covered in our current offerings
- Consider our faculty and resource constraints
- Incorporate perspectives from government, nonprofit, and private sector practice
- Suggest concrete, implementable changes
```

### **Prompt Template for Reasoning Models**

Create prompts for reasoning models using this structure:

```
[GOAL SECTION]
Here is all relevant background information:
- My goal is: ...
- The situation is: ...

[OUTPUT SECTION]
Please provide:
- Specific deliverable requested
- Exact format needed
- Any evaluation criteria

[QUALITY CHECK]
For a good response:
- It should include...
- It should avoid...
- It should consider...

[ADDITIONAL CONTEXT]
Context dump including other information relevant to supporting the task. 
- Previous approaches tried: ...
- Relevant constraints: ...
- Any technical details: ...
- Supporting documents... 
```

Test your template on both model types and reflect on the differences in responses.

## Additional Technical Background

If you're curious about the technology behind reasoning models, here's a brief overview:

**Training Process:**
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Unlike models trained solely on imitation, reasoning models use trial and error to discover effective problem-solving strategies
- **Emergent Behavior**: The model's thinking patterns aren't explicitly programmed‚Äîthey emerge through reinforcement
- **Self-Discovered Techniques**: The model learns to re-evaluate assumptions, backtrack, and try different approaches on its own

**Inference Time Thinking:**
- **Extended Computation**: Reasoning models spend significantly more time "thinking" before responding
- **Built-in Chain of Thought**: While you previously learned to prompt models to "think step by step," reasoning models have this behavior built into their design
- **Visible Thinking Process**: Most interfaces allow you to view the model's reasoning process, giving you insight into how it reached its conclusion

**Resource Implications:**
- **Higher Computational Cost**: Reasoning models require more processing power and energy
- **Longer Response Times**: Responses may take minutes instead of seconds
- **Premium Pricing**: These capabilities typically come with higher subscription costs
