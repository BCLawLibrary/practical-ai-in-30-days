## üìù Part 1: Mastering Image Generation

### Tips for Crafting Better Image Prompts

1. **Start Simple**  
   Begin with a basic prompt to spark inspiration, then refine. You‚Äôd be surprised at how far a single word or idea takes you!  
2. **Use the Formula for Specific Results**  
   **Template:**  
   `[Medium] [Subject] [Subject in Scene] [Optional: Additional Details about subject/scene] [Optional: Color Palettes, Moods] [Optional: Style Elements] [End with specific characteristics related to medium]`  
   * **Example 1:** "Oil painting of a cat reading a book by a fireplace, warm tones, cozy atmosphere. Loose brush strokes, rich texture, and soft edges, impressionist style."  
   * **Example 2**: ‚ÄúCinematic still of a cat reading a book by a crackling fireplace, warm ambient light, soft shadows, and a shallow depth of field, captured on a 35mm film camera, with rich colors and a cozy atmosphere‚Äù  
3. **Leverage AI Chat Tools for Help**  
   * **Inspiration:** Ask for ideas. Example: ‚ÄúSuggest a creative image prompt featuring [my amazing idea].‚Äù  
   * **Prompt Improvement:** Have the AI refine your prompt for more detail.  
   * **Image Description Extraction:** Remember about multimodality\! Upload an image to a chat and have it describe the image in artistic detail. Then reuse the elements in a new prompt.  
   * **Prompt structure extraction and classification**: Copy image descriptions you find online or this advent calendar and ask an AI to break them down into reusable templates. Which leads nicely into...  
4. **Create a Custom Assistant**  
   Develop an AI assistant designed to help you generate image prompts more effectively. [Use the assistant provided](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67648b5da53881918dc869afa640cdd8-image-prompt-assistant), or create your own for practice.

**Bonus: Midjourney Customization**

If you decide to try Midjourney, I highly recommend taking a moment to familiarize yourself with their [customization parameters](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/parameter-list). There are a lot of ways to experiment and tweak your results. It‚Äôs my personal favorite tool but it does take some time to get used to. You can see how I use them in the descriptions for each calendar day.

## üìù Part 2: Putting Everything Together

Now that you've explored image generation, let‚Äôs combine your AI skills for a creative project! Choose one of the following activities:

### Option 1: Illustrated Story Creation üìö

#### Overview:

Create a children's story with custom illustrations, perfect for sharing with family or friends any time of year. This project combines narrative development, character design, and visual storytelling.

#### Workflow Guide

1. **Story Development**
    * Start with ChatGPT or Claude to brainstorm story concepts.
    * Consider themes like:
        * Seasonal adventures
        * Holiday traditions from different cultures
        * Educational topics made fun
        * Family experiences
        * Animal adventures
2. **Character Design**
    * Use your image generator of choice to visualize characters.
    * See if you can maintain consistent style across illustrations 
        * Note: This is notoriously difficult to do with most free image generators. Although, Midjourney provides both ```--sref``` and ```--cref``` parameters to influence style and character references. Also, the new and free [Google Whisk](https://labs.google/fx) image creator allows you to mix and match characters, styles and scenes as well!
        * **Pro tip:** Generate the same character in different poses to ensure consistency by asking for a pose or expression sheet.
3. **Scene Planning**
    * Break story into key moments.
    * Work on one scene at a time.
4. **Assembly and Organization**
    * Save your story and illustrations in Word or Google Docs.
    * Print or share digitally with family and friends.

## Option 2: Enhanced Presentation Visuals

#### Overview

Take a presentation you've already created and use AI to enhance it with fresh perspectives, engaging visuals, and data visualizations. This is perfect for breathing new life into existing lectures, talks, or presentations with minimal extra effort.

#### Quick Start Guide

1. Choose an existing presentation or lecture you'd like to enhance.
2. Copy your notes, outline, or simply explain your topic to an AI assistant.
3. Let AI help generate fresh perspectives and visual ideas.
4. Add engaging visuals and data elements.

#### Workflow Ideas

1. **Start With What You Have**
    * Existing presentation notes
    * Rough outline
    * Key talking points
    * Clearly explain your topic to the AI
2. **Easy Enhancement Process** Start a new chat and try:
    * "I have a presentation about [your topic]. Here are my current notes: [paste notes]"
    * "Can you suggest a fresh outline based on these key points?"
    * "What visuals might make these concepts more memorable?"
3. **Visual Enhancement Options** For Creative Elements:
    * Use your image generator of choice for conceptual or supporting images.
    * Ask for metaphorical illustrations.
    * Generate themed graphics.
4. **For Data and Diagrams**
    * Ask ChatGPT or Claude to create charts or graphs.
    * Request the use of advanced data analysis for precision.
    * Get help visualizing complex concepts.
5. **Quick Wins** Ask AI to suggest:
    * Attention-grabbing openings
    * Memorable examples
    * Clear transitions
    * Impactful closing statements

## Pro Tips

* Let AI suggest new angles you might not have considered.
* Use image generators for abstract concepts or metaphors.
* Ask for visualizations to support key points.
* Upload a screenshot of your slides and ask for tips for improvement to design, content, or both\!
* Remember: AI is enhancing your existing work, not replacing it\!
