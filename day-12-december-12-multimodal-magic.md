# Day 12: December 12: Multimodal Magic üì∏
## **Exploring Computer Vision**

### üéØ **Objective:**

Discover how combining images with questions can unlock powerful AI assistance for everyday problems and presentations.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Tools:**

- Multimodal AI Assistants:
  - [Claude](https://claude.ai)
  - [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)
  - [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)

### üí° **How Others Used This:**

- "I uploaded a photo of my coffee carafe and got exact measurements for the perfect coffee-to-water ratio."
- "Showed AI my spreadsheet of oddly formatted names and got a formula to extract just the first names."
- "Snapped a pic of a confusing parking sign and got a clear yes/no about whether I could park there."
- "Uploaded my presentation slides and got suggestions to improve design, flow, and key talking points."

---

### üìù **Challenge:**

Today is about exploring real-world applications of image + AI assistance. Try any of these ideas or explore multimodal capabilities on your own:

#### **Everyday Mysteries:**

- Snap a photo of a mysterious household item or tool and ask what it's for.
- Troubleshoot a confusing error message on your device.
- Take a picture of a warning light in your car and get immediate help.

#### **Document & Data Help:**

- Upload handwritten notes for transcription or translation.
- Share a screenshot of a spreadsheet for formula help.
- Photograph a form you need help filling out.

#### **Visual Problem Solving:**

- Photograph a parking sign and ask about restrictions.
- Snap a repair/assembly problem you're stuck on.
- Share a screenshot of a software issue.

#### **Presentation Assistance:**

- Upload slides or images for a presentation and ask for feedback on:
  - Design improvements
  - Flow and structure
  - Key talking points

### üì¢ **Example Prompts:**

#### **For Unknown Items:**

```plaintext
I found this in my kitchen drawer [image].
1. What is this tool called?
2. What is it typically used for?
3. Are there any interesting facts about it?
```

#### **For Error Messages:**

```plaintext
I keep getting this error [screenshot] when I try to save my document.
1. What does this error mean in simple terms?
2. What are the most common causes?
3. Can you suggest step-by-step troubleshooting steps?
```

#### **For Presentation Slides:**

```plaintext
Here are my presentation slides on [topic] [image].
1. Can you suggest improvements to the design and layout?
2. Are there ways to make the flow of information clearer?
3. What key talking points should I emphasize?
```

### üí° **Tips:**

- Ensure images are clear and well-lit.
- You still need to include relevant context in your questions.
- Try follow-up questions if the first response isn't quite what you need.
- Experiment with different ways of asking about the same image.

### ü§î **Things to Consider:**

- Some AI assistants might decline to continue the conversation when you upload images with people.
- Personal or sensitive information should be masked in screenshots.
- Complex technical issues might still need professional assistance.
- Image quality significantly affects the AI's ability to help.
