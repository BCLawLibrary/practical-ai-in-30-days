# Day 7: AI Music Studio üéµ
## **More creative expression through AI!**

### üéØ Objective: 
Learn to create music using AI tools while exploring the intersection of human creativity and AI assistance

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools:
- Music Generation:
  - (Free) [Suno](https://suno.com)
  - (Free) [Udio](https://www.udio.com)
  - (Free) [Riffusion](https://www.riffusion.com/)
- AI Writing Assistants for lyrics and descriptions:
  - [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)
  - [Claude](https://claude.ai)
  - [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)

### üìù Challenge:

Suggested Tool: **Suno**

Create an original song using one of the following approaches:
- Your own original lyrics
- Musical meme about the current year's events
- Personal dedication for family/friends
- Cover song in a completely different style

Steps to enhance your creation:
1. Generate or write initial lyrics
2. Experiment with Suno's genre and style options
3. Use AI assistants to refine musical descriptions
4. Try multiple variations with different settings

**Example prompt for an AI writing assistant**: 
Need help crafting a prompt? Copy and paste the starter prompt below into an AI writing assistant. Then use the output for your Suno creation!

"I'd like to create a song using Suno. Could you help me craft lyrics about [your topic] that would work well as a song? Please:
1. Keep verses short and memorable
2. Include a catchy chorus
3. Match the emotional tone of [happy/sad/energetic/calm]
4. Suggest musical style descriptors I can use in Suno, keep it under 200 characters"

---

**Bonus Challenge**: Create two versions of your song in drastically different musical styles and compare how the same lyrics can evoke different emotions.

**üí° Tip**: When describing your desired musical style to Suno, be specific about instruments, tempo, and mood. Try using another AI assistant to help translate your musical preferences into clear, specific descriptions that Suno will understand well. Remember that Suno has a daily limit on free song creation, so plan your variations thoughtfully!
