### üñçÔ∏è Core Idea: What is a System Prompt or Custom Instructions?

A **system prompt** (or [**custom instructions**](https://sites.bc.edu/bclawedtech/2023/10/10/system-prompt/)) is a detailed set of guidelines that you provide to an AI assistant at the start of a conversation. It defines the assistant‚Äôs persona, behavior, and the type of task it should perform. Think of it as a script that tells the AI how to act and respond consistently. [System prompts can be extremely detailed and complex](https://future-cymbal-42b.notion.site/Personal-Copy-Editor-192317d18ec7805db282cace06fd22f9), or they can be incredibly simple as seen below.

**Example system prompt:**

"You are a friendly and efficient email assistant who helps draft professional emails based on bullet points. Always use a clear and concise tone, and check for spelling or grammar errors before finalizing the email."

### üìú Challenge Description

Today, you‚Äôll create a custom AI assistant to help with a task of your choosing. Custom assistants are perfect for tasks where you need:

- **Repetitive workflows** (e.g., summarizing weekly reports, drafting similar emails).
- **Specific formatting** (e.g., legal document templates, structured meeting notes).
- **Consistent context** (e.g., maintaining specific instructions or tone).

You can choose to create a system prompt on your own or feel free to [interact with my custom assistant to help you brainstorm and refine your own](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-674f2452de748191961e54c90e5fc475-custom-chat-assistant)!

If you're unsure where to start, you can have a chat the course's [prompt idea generator](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67cc7060f82c8191a4f05c6e72b1d993-foundations-prompt-idea-generator) first to get some solid starting points.

#### Steps to Create Your Custom Assistant:

1. **Define the Persona**: Who is your assistant? (e.g., a meticulous legal clerk, a cheerful email assistant, or a creative brainstorming partner).

2. **Set Rules & Guidelines**: Outline the behavior and tone. What should they always do or avoid?

3. **(Optional) Add Multi-Shot Examples**: Provide a few sample interactions to show how the assistant should respond.

4. **Include Error Handling**: If colleagues or students use this assistant, add instructions on what to do when errors occur or define interactions or topics to avoid.

5. **Save & Iterate**: Save your system prompt in your preferred tool or set up your assistant in one of the paid/free platforms.

### üìù Communication Skills for Success

One of the key skills you‚Äôll develop in today‚Äôs challenge is **effective communication**. Defining the problem space, asking good questions, and providing clear, actionable instructions will help you achieve better results with your custom assistant. The clearer you are about what you want, the more accurately the AI can assist you. This practice of clarity and precision is valuable not only for AI interactions but also for real-world communication and problem-solving.

### üìñ Example Ideas for Custom Assistants

- **Legal Research Assistant**: Helps summarize case law and format citations.
- **Email Drafting Assistant**: Generates professional emails based on bullet points.
- **Meeting Notes Formatter**: Turns raw meeting notes into structured action items.
- **Code Reviewer**: Reviews code for best practices and common bugs.
- **Social Media Manager**: Suggests engaging posts based on content ideas.
- **Course Materials Tutor**: Helps you process and learn in a personalized way.

### üí° Addtional Tips

- **Keep It Focused**: Start with a simple, well-defined task.
- **Iterate**: Test and refine your prompt until the assistant works as intended.
- **Save Prompts**: Maintain a library of system prompts for different needs.
- **Use My Assistant**: [Talk to my custom assistant to help brainstorm or refine your ideas\!](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-674f2452de748191961e54c90e5fc475-custom-chat-assistant)

### Next Steps: Creating and Sharing Custom Chat Assistants

While it's easy enough to copy and paste your instructions at the beginning of the chat to assign the role to your chat assistant, you'll probably start to wish that you could have a predefined chat assistant that already has these instructions "built-in" and ready to go. This is where custom assistant features come in to play from the primary chat assistant platforms like [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Claude](https://claude.ai) or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com). Not only can you create and use these custom assistants for yourself, but platforms like ChatGPT allow you to share links to your creations to the public and team plans with Claude let you share your creations with other members of your team. The custom assistants created for this course are customGPTs built in ChatGPT for example and allow you to access a specialized chat assistant via public link.

The key thing to know here is that this is simply a way for you to reuse a set of instructions without needing to copy and paste a prompt to start your chat everytime. The prompt you configure in the settings of your custom assistant gets inserted as the first message of the conversation automatically for you. This helps save you time to get up and running for your specific purpose, it let's you update it easily in one location, and if you're working with a team or have shared your creation with a paid plan, everyone gets the benefit of the updated prompt without any additional work on their end.
