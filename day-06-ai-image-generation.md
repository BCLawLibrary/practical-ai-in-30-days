# AI Image Generation with Large Language Models
## **Creative Visualization!**

### üéØ Objective: 
Learn the basics of creating images with AI using Large Language Models (LLMs)

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools:
- [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) (Free)
- [Google AI Test Kitchen](https://labs.google/fx/tools/image-fx) (Free)

### üìù Challenge:
Today we're going to experiment with creating images using Gemini. You'll be using their Imagen3 model, which is particularly good at illustrations and creative designs. You can create any type of image that interests you. Here are some themes to spark your imagination:

**Theme 1: Nature & Landscapes**
- A serene mountain vista
- A tropical beach scene
- A mystical forest
- A vibrant garden

**Example prompt**: 
Create an illustration of a peaceful forest clearing with sunbeams filtering through tall trees. Use a soft, dreamy art style with natural colors.

**Theme 2: BC Campus Life**
- Baldwin the Eagle in action
- Gasson Hall at sunset
- BC's campus scenes
- Eagles sports moments
- Commonwealth Ave in different seasons

**Example prompt**:
Create an illustration of Boston College's Mascot, Baldwin the eagle, Baldwin is standing at the top of Heartbreak hill holding a sign saying "Mile 20, You've got this!"

### üí° Tip: 
To get Gemini to create an image just ask! If you're new to image prompting, here are some helpful strategies:

- Start simple! Try a basic prompt first, then add 1-2 details like colors or style if you want to refine it.
- Gemini is pretty good at including text in a generated image. Include text in your images by putting the desired words in quotes
- Test different art mediums: watercolor, digital illustration, pen and ink
- Test different artistic periods or movements: Art Deco, The Dutch Golden Age, Ukiyo-e
- Ask an LLM for help crafting a prompt first. Describe what you're looking for and ask a chat assistant to craft the perfect AI image prompt.

### ‚ú® Bonus:
Take your favorite image and recreate it with a twist! Try:
- A different art style (like watercolor or pixel art)
- A new color palette
- A different medium
- An unexpected mood
Get creative - sometimes the most interesting results come from unusual combinations!
