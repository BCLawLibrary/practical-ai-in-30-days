## A Friendly Introduction

### üéØ Objective:

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools (Pick One): 
Note: All of these tools have a free tier.
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)
- [Claude](https://claude.ai)
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)
- [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)
- [CoPilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com)

### Overview:
One of the first hurdles when starting with AI chat assistants is the "Blank Input" problem‚Äîstaring at an empty chat window, unsure of what to ask or how to begin. This is completely normal! Today's activity is designed to help you overcome this initial hesitation by providing an engaging, reflective, and iterative way to interact with AI. 

You'll have the option to use a custom chat assistant we've prepared, which includes detailed guidance to help you through the process. Alternatively, you can simply copy and paste one of the provided prompts below into your preferred AI tool. The goal is to get comfortable interacting with AI early and often, building confidence and discovering practical ways AI can support your studies, work, or hobbies.

### üìù Challenge:
Have a conversation with an AI chat assistant. 

**Sample prompts:**
1. "I'm a [your role] at [_Boston College Law School_ OR _your organization_]. What are 3 ways AI could help me with my daily tasks?"
2. "Help me brainstorm one new way to use AI in my work or personal life this week."
3. "Help me identify one AI skill I could develop this month that would be valuable for my legal career."

üí° **Tip:** Treat this like a conversation 
- Ask the AI to be proactive and ask questions to help tailor the recommendations to your needs
- Follow up on one of the AI‚Äôs suggestions 
- Ask for more examples or dive deeper into how it works
- Give more context about yourself to get more detailed and tailored responses

## Image Description
Made with [Imagen3](https://labs.google.com/fx/tools/image-fx): "a small green sprout emerging from the ground, with a simple, gently curved stem and two small, minimalist leaves. The sprout then seamlessly transitions upwards into a stylized tree trunk that becomes increasingly geometric and digital, culminating in an upper portion where the branches are formed by clean, geometric lines resembling a circuit board pattern, with simplified, abstract representations of leaves made from small, angular shapes connected to the circuit-branches. The entire design will utilize a limited color palette, primarily soft green for the sprout, transitioning into a darker, more vibrant green for the circuit-tree portion, against a neutral background."
