# Day 6: Day 6: AI Holiday Themed Images
## **Festive Fun!**

### üéØ Objective: 
Learn the basics of creating images with AI with Large Language Models (LLMs)

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools:
- [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) (Free)
- [Google AI Test Kitchen](https://labs.google/fx/tools/image-fx) (Free)

### üìù Challenge:
Today we're going to experiment with creating images using Gemini. You'll be using their Imagen3 model, which is particularly good at illustrations and creative designs. You can create a cheerful holiday-themed image or explore any style that interests you. Here are some themes to spark your imagination:

**Theme 1: Holid"ai"ys**
- A decorated Christmas tree
- A cozy winter scene
- Holiday cookies and treats
- A snowman

**Example prompt**: 
Create an illustration of a cheerful snowman wearing a red scarf and holding a candy cane. Use a cute cartoon style with bright colors.

**Theme 2: E"ai"gle Pride**
- Baldwin the Eagle spreading holiday cheer
- Gasson Hall decorated for the season
- BC's campus in a snow globe
- Eagles football helmet with holiday decorations
- Maroon and gold ornaments on Commonwealth Ave

**Example prompt**:
Create an illustration of Boston College's Mascot, Baldwin the eagle, Baldwin is standing at the top of Heartbreak hill holding a sign saying "Mile 20, You've got this!"

### üí° Tip: 
To get Gemini to create an image just ask! If you're new to image prompting, here are some helpful strategies:

- Start simple! Try a basic prompt first, then add 1-2 details like colors or style if you want to refine it.
- Gemini is pretty good at including text in a generated image. Include text in your images by putting the desired words in quotes
- Test different art mediums: watercolor, digital illustration, pen and ink
- Test different artistic periods or movements: Art Deco, The Dutch Golden Age, Ukiyo-e
- Ask an LLM for help crafting a prompt first. Describe what you're looking for and ask a chat assistant to craft the perfect AI image prompt.

### ‚ú® Bonus:
Take your favorite image and recreate it with a twist! Try:
- A different art style (like watercolor or pixel art)
- A new color palette
- A different medium
- An unexpected mood
Get creative - sometimes the most interesting results come from unusual combinations!
