**üí° Tip**: The goal isn't to replace reading or traditional study methods, but to supplement them with different perspectives and learning styles. Consider how this tool could make complex content more accessible to different types of learners.

### üéì Real-World Examples:
1. [Legal Education Example](https://youtu.be/eKdzkG-pf2Y?si=kT_XtqwjNwv3iykc&t=267)
2. [NotebookLM Podcast: Creating Sully](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/774dc337-cd3d-41a8-b2a3-847d72656dc2/audio): This audio podcast represents one example of how insightful and thoughtful the generated content from these tools can be. Th podcast was generated from the source material provided as part of a project to create an AI persona called Sully. In particular, I want to call out the "hosts" thoughtful discussion about inclusivity and stereotypes that should be considered when developing custom chat assistants, particularly those meant to capture local flair.

### ü§ù Inclusive Design Considerations:
As a bonus, I'm providing an abbreviated conversation I had with Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model after listening to the podcast created by NotebookLM. This is [a reflective conversation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1doltLDeoH3Ol3fYyVwQ1XYD89W0g68YUiup2_4uQQ08/edit?usp=sharing) that highlights the kind of meaningful dialog you can have with AI chat assistants to not only improve your work, but reflect on and improve yourself as well.

In particular it raises questions to ask yourself when designing AI chat assistants and personas that you plan on sharing with others. Something you'll learn how to do in future activities.
- How can AI voices and personalities reflect diverse backgrounds authentically?
- What stereotypes should we be careful to avoid?
- How can AI tools make education more accessible to different learning styles?
