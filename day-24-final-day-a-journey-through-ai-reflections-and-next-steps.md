## ✨ Reflections on AI & Societal Change  

The development of AI is moving at a blistering pace—[what was science fiction in 2022](https://x.com/emollick/status/1869077739485253659?s=12&t=6Q7ZpHLPwTuRWMRW61xSxw) is now available in consumer tools, and [what's experimental today](https://x.com/livekit/status/1870194686532694417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1870194686532694417%7Ctwgr%5E08c21ca839c163d0ac611418e179aebc248c55f0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fkyle-ts%2FUltimate-Brain-87b49ba845e149699d9876ebae626519%3Fp%3D15eb37cc433981e5bff9fcfc15e059b5pm%3Ds) will likely be [commonplace by next year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctWfv4WUp2I). As humans, we tend to normalize these advances quickly, making it easy to overlook just how exponential this growth is. We're living through a fascinating period where tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are matching or exceeding human performance in specific domains, and we're all collectively figuring out what this means in real-time.  

I like the analogy my colleague, Tim Lindgren, uses—AI as a *"bicycle for the mind."* It's a tool that can take you further than you might go on your own, but you're still the one pedaling, in control of the direction and effort. This speaks to several things that are important to keep in mind. It's hard to fall asleep at the wheel so to speak when you're riding a bike. The element of human oversight, guidance, and critical evaluation is still very important when using these new tools. When used with intention and grounding conversations and tasks in both high quality context and your own personal context, you truly can go much farther much faster than you otherwise might be able to on your own. 

At the same time, AI is advancing so rapidly that the bicycle analogy may undersell today's capabilities. These systems are increasingly solving complex problems that challenge even human experts. Recent benchmarks like GPQA (Epoch AI, 2025) show LLMs now outperforming specialized human experts on particularly difficult questions across mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Even leading AI researchers are surprised by the pace of these developments. In many ways, AI isn't just a bicycle; it's more like a plane. When you're on course, it can get you to your destination far faster than you otherwise would. But unlike a plane with autopilot, AI doesn't always recognize when it's off track—it just keeps going. A small trajectory shift early on can compound over time, especially in complex workflows or automated systems where AI is making incremental decisions. By the time it comes back to you, significant course correction may be needed to ensure it actually landed where you intended.  

All of this is to say, rather than fearing AI or avoiding its use, the goal is to stay engaged and intentional in how we use it. The more actively you pilot the tool, the more you amplify its benefits—turning it into something that works *for* you and *with* you, not the other way around.  


### Key Questions to Consider:

1. **What problems can AI help me solve?**  
   How can your domain expertise and unique insights help you ask better questions and build better systems?

2. **How can I build my AI 'muscle'?**  
   Like any skill, using AI effectively requires practice, experimentation, and iteration.

3. **What role should AI play in my life?**  
   Everyone's relationship with AI is different. Whether it's an occasional assistant or a daily collaborator, over time you'll find what works for you.

## 💡 My Biggest Tips & Takeaways

If you're still unsure about AI or struggling to see where it fits into your work, here's a powerful suggestion: start by using AI to get feedback on your work. This is the lowest-hanging fruit that most people overlook. Even if you don't end up using AI's suggestions directly, asking for feedback with proper context will almost always spark ideas to move you in a helpful direction.

Here are some other takeaways from my AI journey:

- Finding the value of AI is deeply personal - shaped by your unique context, expertise, and goals. You will most likely find that AI is transformative for one task or purpose, simply useful or mediocre in others, and even downright useless, anti-productive, or harmful for others.  
- Your creativity and ingenuity in surfacing relevant knowledge, resources, and context for AI tools will set you apart. Think of yourself as an orchestrator, bringing together the right pieces of content and information at the right time for AI to work with.  
- The ability to curate and structure information for LLMs is, for now, a crucial skill. The difference between basic and exceptional AI use often lies in how well you can feed it the right context.  
- The real magic happens when you shift from seeking output to seeking input. Use AI to refine and challenge your ideas, not just generate content.  
- Build your AI intuition gradually. Start with small experiments, learn from the surprises (both good and bad), and keep iterating.  
- Scale your thinking. Instead of tweaking one email, generate dozens of variations. Rather than brainstorming a few ideas, explore hundreds of possibilities. LLMs thrive on scale—tap into their capacity to explore an entire universe of options quickly and effortlessly.  
- AI isn't a mindreader - the art of effective prompting is about clearly communicating your needs and requirements. The more specific you are about what you want, the better your results will be.  
- Don't forget, AI can be fun! Embrace the playful side of AI. Try out different personas, write silly stories, or frame questions through the lens of your favorite characters. Sometimes, the best explanations and insights come from these more creative, unconventional approaches.

### Next Steps

**Premium Options to Consider:** 

When you're ready to take your AI usage to the next level, consider investing in a paid tier of your preferred platform. For approximately $20/month, you can access:

* Higher rate limits and access to the most advanced models  
* Longer conversations  
* Advanced features like custom GPTs, projects, personalization, code execution, data analysis, or advanced Voice with ChatGPT  
* Multimodal capabilities (files/image/audio/video)  
* Priority access during peak times

My recommendation? Start with the free tiers to discover which interface and capabilities best match your needs. Once you've identified your preferred platform and are consistently pushing against free tier limits, or find that free tier features are not meeting your needs, that's the time to consider a premium subscription. The productivity gains and quality of life improvements can far outweigh the cost for regular users.
