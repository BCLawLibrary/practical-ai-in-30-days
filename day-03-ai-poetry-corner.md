### üìù Challenge:
Generative AI isn't just for serious work‚Äîit's also a wonderful tool for creative expression! Today's challenge invites you to explore AI's artistic capabilities while having some fun with poetry. You might discover new creative possibilities or even uncover your own poetic voice along the way.

Create a poem using these formats:
- Haiku (3 lines: 5-7-5 syllables)
- Limerick (5 lines with AABBA rhyme scheme)
- Free verse with specific memories
- Acrostic using a meaningful word
- Some other format of your choosing

Your poem could be:
- A personal poem for a friend or family member
- A reflection on your work or profession
- An ode to a hobby or interest you're passionate about
- Or anything else you want to explore

**Example prompts**: 
1. "Help me write a haiku for my sister who always supported my dreams. She loves gardening and makes the best chocolate chip cookies. I want to thank her for always being there for me."

2. "I'd like a limerick about being a law professor. I especially enjoy constitutional law debates and helping students find their voice in moot court. The most rewarding part is seeing students have 'aha' moments when complex concepts click."

**üí° Tip**: Include specific details - hobbies, memorable moments, inside jokes, or unique qualities. The more personal details you provide, the more meaningful the poem will be!
